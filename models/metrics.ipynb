In karst areas, small to medium-sized shallow pits are formed due to seepage of surface water, and these shallow pits are called sinkholes. Surface water from these sinkholes drains into the underground. The bottom of these sinkholes forms underground caves and sinkholes sometimes collapse and are commonly called collapse sinks or dolines. Typically, surface runoff runs down through sinkholes and flows underground, and at some distance through cave openings again to the surface. valley sinks or uvulas are developed when sinkholes and doline join together due to the collapse of cave ceilings.</td>\n",

       "0  A sink hole is on opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom with sizes varying in area from a few sq.m to a hectare and with depth from a less than half a metre to thirty metres or more. Quite often the surface run-off simply goes down swallow and sink holes and flow as underground streams and re-emerge at a distance downstream through a cave opening. A doline is a collapsed sink. When sinkholes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials along their margins or due to roof collapse of caves, long narrow to wide trenches called valley sinks or uvalas form.   \n",

       "0  Valley sinks or uvulas are the same things. Valley sinks are erosional landforms of Karst topography. The following way valley sinks are evolved: In dolomite, limestone, or karst zones, the rocks are permeable and are made up of highly fused and broken rocks. In karst areas, small to medium-sized shallow pits are formed due to seepage of surface water, and these shallow pits are called sinkholes. Surface water from these sinkholes drains into the underground. The bottom of these sinkholes forms underground caves and sinkholes sometimes collapse and are commonly called collapse sinks or dolines. Typically, surface runoff runs down through sinkholes and flows underground, and at some distance through cave openings again to the surface. valley sinks or uvulas are developed when sinkholes and doline join together due to the collapse of cave ceilings.
